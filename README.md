# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake Game using the `curses` library in Python. The game allows the player to control a snake that grows in length as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with the walls and itself.

## Features

- Control the snake using the arrow keys.
- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or itself.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. The `curses` library is typically included in the standard library for Unix-like systems. If you are using Windows, you may need to install a compatible version of the `curses` library.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies (if necessary).

## Running the Game

To run the Snake Game, you have two options:

1- Execute the Python script: Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the following command:

```bash
python src/snake_game.py
```
2- Use the executable version: Navigate to the `Ready To Play` folder in the repository and simply run the executable file.

Enjoy playing the game!
